function R = spfunscalars(C, func, stab)
%% This function applies a matrix-valued spectral function
%  to a 2d hermitian matrix field (an image of matrices).
%  Is is optimized for hermitian matrices of size up to 3x3.
%  It applies FUNC to the eigenvalues of the matrix field C
%  and reconstruct a matrix field with the same eigenvectors.
%  A detailed description is given in
%
%    Deledalle, C.A., Denis, L., Tabti, S. and Tupin, F., 2017.
%    Closed-form expression of the eigen decomposition
%    of 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 Hermitian matrices
%
%  Warning: if the matrices in input are not hermitian, the output
%  of this function will be nonsense.
%
%  Warning: if the matrices have zero entries or equal eigenvalue,
%  the function may crash or produce an unexpected result.
%  Please use stabmatrices on C, prior to calling this function,
%  in oreder to avoid such numerical issues.
%
% Input/Output
%
%    C          a M x N field of D x D hermitian matrices
%               size D x D x M x N
%               Input:  eigenvalues are lambda_i
%               Output: eigenvalues are func(lambda_i)
%                       eigenvectors are preserved
%
%    func       a scalar function
